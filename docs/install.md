## Run Sugarizer using Docker

To run Sugarizer Server using Docker and Docker Compose:

**Clone Sugarizer Client and Sugarizer Server**

	git clone https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer
	git clone https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer-server

**Install Docker and Docker Compose on Ubuntu**

	curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

Install Docker Compose

	curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.8.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
	chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

If you have problems installing with `curl`, you can use `pip` instead: `pip install -U docker-compose`

To install Docker Compose on ARM architectures (e.g. for the Raspberry Pi 3), the link above will not work.  You need to use [arm-compose](https://github.com/hypriot/arm-compose) instead.

You can find more details about the installation of **Docker** [here](https://docker.github.io/engine/installation/)

You can	find more details about	the installation of **Docker Compose** [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Test the installation 
    docker-compose --version

After that, go to the Sugarizer Server folder and launch

	cd sugarizer-server
	sh generate-docker-compose.sh
	docker-compose up -d

Your Sugarizer server will start automatically and will be accessible on http://127.0.0.1:8080 and your public IP. The database will be persisted inside the folder docker/db.

## Run Sugarizer on Linux

To run Sugarizer Server **without Docker**, follow the step behind. Commands are shown from a new Debian Linux machine and could be different for other Linux distribution or for an already installed machine:


**Install Node.js**: Install Node.js (6+) and npm to manage packages. See [here](http://nodejs.org/ "here") more information.

    sudo apt update
	sudo apt install nodejs

**Install MongoDB**: Install MongoDB (2.6+). Don't forget to create a /data/db directory to store databases. See [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ "here") for more information.

    sudo apt-get install mongodb
    sudo mkdir -p /data/db

**Install Git**: Install Git (2.17+). 

    sudo apt update 
	sudo apt install git

**Install Sugarizer Client and Server**: If need, you could update sugarizer-server/sugarizer.ini file (update port for web, mongodb or presence, see below)

    git clone https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer
    git clone https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer-server
    cd sugarizer-server
    npm install

**Run MongoDB and Sugarizer Server**:Run mongo daemon and Sugarizer a background process.

    sudo mongod --fork --port 27018 --logpath ~/mongo.log
    nohup node sugarizer.js > ~/sugarizer.log

*Warning:* If your server had an unclean shutdown on previous boot, MongoDB could not start correctly telling that some files are locked. In that case, launch first:

	sudo mongod --repair


## Run Sugarizer on MacOS

**Install homebrew**:Run this command on terminal

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

*To check the version type the following command.*
        
    brew -v

**Installing Node.js**:In the terminal type the following command to install Node.
        
    brew install node

*If everything installed successfully then you can type in the following command in the terminal to check the Node and NPM version.*
        
    node -v
    npm -v

**Install and Run MongoDB with Homebrew**

*Open the Terminal and type*

    brew install mongodb

*After downloading Mongo, create the “db” directory. This is where the Mongo data files will live. You can create the directory in the default location by running*
        
    mkdir -p /data/db

*Make sure that the /data/db directory has the right permissions by running*
        
    sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db

Run the Mongo daemon, in one of your terminal windows run " mongod ". This should start the Mongo server. 

To stop the Mongo daemon hit `command + c`


**Install Sugarizer Client and Server**

    brew install git
    cd desktop
    git clone https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer
    git clone https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer-server
    cd sugarizer-server
    npm install

**Run MongoDB and Sugarizer Server**:Run mongod and Sugarizer.

    mongod
    node sugarizer.js


## Run Sugarizer on a RaspberryPI

To deploy Sugarizer Server on a Raspberry Pi, you could use instructions above to deploy on Linux or to deploy on Docker.

A specific packaging name [Sugarizer Schoolbox](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer-school-box) is also available [here](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer-school-box) but is currently **deprecated**.


## Run Sugarizer on the cloud

You could install on any existing cloud platform (Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, ...). Detail of settings for:

* **Google Cloud Platform** is available [here](deploytoGCP.md),
* **Amazon Web Services** is available [here](deploytoAWS.md).


## Check your install

To check your Sugarizer Server install, run "http://127.0.0.1:8080" in your browser:

* once a new user created, you should see the home with all activities,
* go to Journal view, you should see at the bottom of the screen the two icons to switch to private/shared journal,
* go to the neighborhood view, you should see one icon for the server and one for you.
